# Python + HPC (PBS) Course for Quantum Optics/Many-Body Simulations

This repository contains a 3-tutorial master-level course on:
- Scientific Python workflows
- VS Code productivity for research code
- HPC cluster execution with PBS job submission

## Course scope
We focus on three problem classes:
1. **MCWF simulations** (trajectory-based workflows)
2. **Mean-field (MF) many-ODE systems**
3. **Matrix diagonalization on GPU**


## Repository layout
- `docs/` lecture plans and tex slides
- `examples/` code examples for all topics 
- `pbs/` placeholder folder for cluster scripts
- `data/`, `results/`, `logs/` placeholders for project artifacts
- `.vscode/` recommended editor setup

## Suggested delivery (3 lectures)
- **Lecture 1:** problem overview + mean-field equations
