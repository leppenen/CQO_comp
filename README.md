# Python + HPC (PBS) Course for Quantum Optics/Many-Body Simulations

This repository contains a 3-lecture master-level course on:
- Scientific Python workflows
- VS Code productivity for research code
- HPC cluster execution with PBS job submission

## Course scope
We focus on three problem classes:
1. **MCWF simulations** (trajectory-based workflows)
2. **Mean-field (MF) many-ODE systems**
3. **Matrix diagonalization on GPU**

For each class, students learn:
- Problem context and representative results
- Python implementation structure
- How to submit, monitor, and debug runs on an HPC cluster (PBS)

## Repository layout
- `docs/` lecture plans, syllabus, and assessment
- `examples/` placeholder folder for your own code
- `pbs/` placeholder folder for your own cluster scripts
- `exercises/` placeholder folder for your own student tasks
- `data/`, `results/`, `logs/` placeholders for project artifacts
- `.vscode/` recommended editor setup

## Suggested delivery (3 lectures)
- **Lecture 1:** problem overview + first MCWF trajectory array run on cluster
- **Lecture 2:** implementation walkthroughs in Python + VS Code workflow
- **Lecture 3:** PBS scaling, resource tuning, reproducibility, troubleshooting

See `docs/syllabus.md` for detailed timing.

## Notes
- This repo is intentionally a planning and structure template.
- You can drop in your own examples, PBS scripts, and exercise sheets in the placeholder folders.
