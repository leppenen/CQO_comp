# Syllabus: Python + VS Code + HPC (PBS)


I want to show how to use HPC cluster chemfarm and also tools I am using. I have 3 examples on my mind: Monte Carlo wave function simulations, Mean field solver, Matrix Diagonalization using GPU. I suggest if we meet I will show how do I run Monte Carlo wave function on a cluster. We will discuss some physics and theory behind it and maybe some ideas how we could use it in our different projects. I will show how do I use VS Code, GitHub copilot, Python, Bash, PBS script. I will also quickly overview the tools we have available of chemfarm now.
